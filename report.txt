============================ ASSIGNMENT REPORT ============================
Assignment name is: Wildfire
My name is: Jatin Jain

	[USE PLAIN TEXT]
	[INSERT ANSWERS AFTER EACH QUESTION AND ADD MORE LINES AS NEEDED.]
	[MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

===== In what cases does the program run correctly?  =================
- if bad arguments provided, program runs with default values after printing error
- if good aruments provided runs with those arguments

===== In what cases does the program fail and how?  ==================
- - If the grid size is set outside the defined limits (less than 5 or greater than 40), it defaults to the standard size without clear notification.
 - If invalid character inputs are provided (not among defined constants), the program may produce undefined behavior or fail to compile.
 - Potential memory issues if grid size is set dynamically without proper bounds checking.

===== If applicable, what were the extra credit results?  ============
- implemented dampness - where during grid initialization there is a 1 in 4 chanv\ce for a damp tree to be initialised randomly
- if the tree is damp e_pCatch is calculated by subtracting the stdin -DN value and implementing the same susceptibility logic
- -1 < N < 100 that is a tree is by default dry pDampness = 0, but if -DN passed should be in the value range s[pecified
- assigns to default if bad params passed

- implemented lightning where -Ln, n should be in the range -1<n<100, and default value is 0, 
- no lightning strikes happen in this vcase as we specify lightning_liklness < pLightning, thereby ensuring the above
- if the likliness of lightning is less than pLightning then lightning strikes a tree (!)
- cycle loop :
    Y -> ! -> * (3 cycles) -> .
      -> ! -> Y 
- some good values are -L50, -L40 where we can see lightning strike atleast once and burn a tree.
- ./wildfire -d100 -c100 -b5 -n30 [-L60] run with and without to see the effect 
- ./wildfire -d100 -c100 -b1 [-L60] run with and without to see the difference 

===== If applicable, describe how to run the extra credit.  ==========
 - to run extra credit code, just specify -Ln or -DN paramaters in stdin 
    eg: ./wildfire -L50 //runs with pLightning 50, and default arguments 
===== How much time did I spend on the project?  =====================
 Approximately 15 hours including research, coding, and testing.

===== What did I learn?  =============================================
Gained experience with simulation algorithms and grid-based representations.
 - Improved understanding of user input handling and error management in C.
 - Learned about terminal control for dynamic output display.

===== What was easy in this assignment?  =============================
Setting up the basic grid structure and initial conditions for the simulation.
- Implementing the logic for tree growth and burning states.

===== What gave me problems or troubles?  ============================
 Debugging issues related to pointer arithmetic and array bounds in C.
 - Ensuring that the simulation properly handled various input scenarios.
 - Overlay disply mode
 - logic for simulation, and keeping track of fire states
===== What would be the most important improvement for the project?  =
- reduce timme and memory complexity, being able to use malloc 

===== What else would I have liked to do for this assignment?  =======
- grow trees, trees near more trees afrter couple cycles grows
- adding more environmental factors like wind inflkuence ext.
